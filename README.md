This dataset, which contains Amazon product data, includes product categories and various metadata. The product with the most comments in the electronics category has user ratings and comments. I have determined the reviews to be displayed on the product detail page of the product.


## Comparison Bidding Methods with A/B Testing

This data set, which contains information about a company's website, includes information such as the number of ads that users have seen and clicked on, as well as the income information from there. There are two separate data sets, Control and Test groups. Maximum Bidding was applied to the control group, and AverageBidding was applied to the test group.
