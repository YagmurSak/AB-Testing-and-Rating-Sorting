## Rating Product & Sorting Reviews in Amazon

This dataset, which contains Amazon product data, includes product categories and various metadata. The product with the most comments in the electronics category has user ratings and comments. I have determined the reviews to be displayed on the product detail page of the product.


## Comparison Bidding Methods with A/B Testing

Facebook recently introduced a new bid type called "averagebidding" as an alternative to the existing bidding type called "maximumbidding".This data set, which contains information about a company's website, includes information such as the number of ads that users have seen and clicked on and the income information from there. I applied the AB test to see if averagebidding would bring more conversions than maximumbidding.
